# datafact template: hello world

                This dataset is built by the datafact template: \`hello-world\`,
                it provides a simple collection of "Hello World" translations in various languages.

                Implement a function called \`create_data_dict\` which produce the content of your dataset.

                * type.py
                Provide your type annotation in the \`data_types\` dictionary in this file.

                * README.md
                Provide the readme document of your dataset in this file.

                ## Build Dataset

Code:

```typescript jsx
import {ConsoleCommand} from "@dataset.sh/cmd-output";

function MyPage() {
    return <>
    <ConsoleCommand input={'datafact experimental auto-doc'}/>
    <ConsoleCommand
