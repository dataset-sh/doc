`dataset.sh` is a dataset manager designed to simplify the process of installing, managing, and publishing datasets.
We hope to make working with datasets as straightforward as using package managers like npm or pip for programming
libraries.

## Install

To get started, you can install `dataset.sh` via pip:

```bash
pip install dataset.sh -U
dataset.sh --help
```

## How to create and publish datasets

You can build and publish datasets using

* [**dataset factory (datafact)** ](/docs/create-dataset/datafact/intro).

     Our dataset publishing framework, design to make the publishing experience as smooth as possible.

* [**the built-in API**](/docs/create-dataset/api/guide):

    more low level and flexible but may require more work.



### Examples

<DatasetCreationContent/>

## How to import datasets

You can load the content of dataset by following the instruction on our dataset browser web ui.

```shell title="open gui from command line"
dataset.sh gui hello/world
```
