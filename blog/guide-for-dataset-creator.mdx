# Guide For Dataset Creators

{/* truncate */}

## What do you need to know

* [General Best Practice](/docs/create-dataset/tips)
* **(Optional)** How to use `easytype` to provide type annotation.
* How to create a dataset bundle using one of the following:
    * `dataset.sh` API: [Tutorial](/)
    * `datafact`: Tutorial
* creating synthetic datasets? You may also want to learn `mkb`
* How to verify dataset quality? (How good does the data capture your intents)
* setup dataset.sh account and upload to our public dataset repository server.


## What datasets can I build?
* create synthetic datasets using generative model
* convert old datasets
* crowdsource or annotate them yourself
* convert from knowledge graph (e.g. wikidata)

## Want to build applications with data?

You can build
* Open source ML model using our datasets
* Web/Mobile app that display/navigate/visualize data so human can learn from it
* Video that visualize data
* Informative graphic data visualization

## Want to contribute to the `dataset.sh` core software?
You want to
    * understand the internal data structure
    * understand the communication protocol

## Looking for Ideas?

If you want to contribute but don't know where to start, you can consider the following:

1. create synthetic datasets using generative model
2. convert old datasets
3. crowdsource or annotate them yourself
4. convert from knowledge graph (e.g. wikidata)

for applications:
1. consider build and open source ML model using our datasets
2. create data visualization
3. use data for your app
